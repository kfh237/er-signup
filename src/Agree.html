    <h1>NYU Game Center Equipment Rental Policy</h1>
    <p>Revision 0.2; Last Revised 6/29/2023</p>

    <p>Our equipment room is available to Game Center students, Game Center Faculty, and NYU students who are currently enrolled in a Game Center course. In order to access equipment, you must first register via this form [tk].</p>

    <h2>Equipment Types</h2>
    <p>Equipment at the Game Center is grouped into three categories.
        <ul>
            <li>Bulk items are items such as cables, adapters, keyboards, and mice, which are not individually itemized with their own asset numbers.</li>
            <li>Standard items are commonly-used, individually itemized pieces of equipment such as game controllers, speakers, headphones, or webcams.</li>
            <li>Specialty items are high-cost things like laptops, monitors, televisions, VR headsets, or DSLR cameras. These may be subject to special requirements around damage liability.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Loan Duration</h2>
    <p>Equipment of any type can be rented on either a short-term or long-term basis. With limited exceptions, students can take equipment off campus, as long as it’s approved by the Production Technician and returned on-time and in good condition.</p>
    <h3>Short-Term</h3>
    <p>A short-term rental is one that lasts for under 24 hours. Failure to return a short-term rental on time without prior approval from the Production Technician will result in one strike. After three strikes, the student will receive a penalty.</p>
    <h3>Long-term</h3>
    <p>Any rental lasting over 24 hours is considered a long-term rental, and requires prior approval from the Production Technician. Failure to return a long-term rental on time without prior approval from the Production Technician will result in an immediate penalty.</p>
    <p>Due to limited inventory, certain specialty items may have a maximum availability of two weeks.</p> 
    
    <h2>Returns and Extensions</h2>
    <p>All equipment should be returned directly to the office of the Production Technician in room 603. The office is open Monday thru Friday, 10am-6pm in the Fall and Spring semesters, and 1:30pm-5:30pm in the Summer semester.</p>
    <p>If the office is closed and the Library is open, Bulk and Standard items may be returned to the librarians on duty. Special items can only be returned to the Production Technician’s office.</p>
    <p>To extend a rental, students must contact the Production Technician no less than 24 hours prior to their scheduled return date. Extensions should be requested in person at the Production Technician’s office, but requesting an extension via Slack or e-mail is acceptable as long as correspondence is sent 24 hours prior to the scheduled return date.</p>

    <h2>Special Events</h2>
    <p>Certain special events, such as the Spring Showcase, will use an alternate process for reserving and renting equipment. To ensure everyone’s needs are met, there may be a general call to return all outstanding equipment prior to a major event.</p>
    
    <h2>Damage and Loss</h2>
    <p>Damage to any item will result in one strike. If the damaged item is a specialty item, the student may also be responsible for getting it repaired.</p>

    <p>Loss of a bulk or standard item will result in one strike. Loss of a specialty item may result in immediate penalty, and the student must meet with the Production Technician to explain the circumstances.</p>

    <h2>Strikes and Penalties</h2>
    <p>Three strikes equal one penalty. A student’s first penalty will result in suspension of equipment rental privileges for the remainder of the semester. If the student receives a second penalty, they are permanently banned from renting equipment.</p>
    <h3>Appeals</h3>
    <p>Students have the right to meet with the Production Technician and appeal any strike they receive. Appeals are granted at the discretion of the Production Technician, and result in the reversal of a strike. In the case of a penalty, the Production Technician may call on additional review from the Tech Ops Administrator, Administrative Director, and Department Chair.</p>
